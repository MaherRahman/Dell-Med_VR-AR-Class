preclass material using SugarCube and Twine

The purpose of this is to create a structured and well organized pre-class material for the First Year Medical students in their course introducing them to XR, or extended reality. 

This program will use SugarCube and Twine to make a cleaner and more visually appealing format for the students to click through and learn necessary information before their class day.
